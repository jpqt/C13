# Venture Funding with Deep Learning
We work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked to help  create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks,  decide how to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.
## Technologies

The project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [python](https://www.python.org/) - Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

* [Sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use in research and production.
